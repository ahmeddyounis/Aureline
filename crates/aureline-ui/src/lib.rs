//! Shared UI primitives and contracts.
//!
//! This crate is the cross-surface home for appearance primitives and the
//! semantic token registry used by first-party UI surfaces.
//!
//! [`m5_structured_input_and_staged_review::M5StructuredInputSetPacket`] freezes
//! the canonical structured-input, parameter-provenance, draft-state, and
//! staged-review truth shared by mutation-capable forms, wizards, and review
//! sheets across the provider, admin, request, package, import, settings, and
//! project lanes. Each
//! [`m5_structured_input_and_staged_review::FormSurfaceRecord`] binds field
//! provenance, validation state, draft/applied recovery, submit blockers, and a
//! staged-review (commit) sheet, then re-derives a
//! [`m5_structured_input_and_staged_review::SurfaceClaim`] so a form can never
//! submit from a source-hidden state, hide target scope, omitted defaults,
//! blocked prerequisites, or rollback consequences behind a generic Continue, or
//! discard a recoverable draft. Downstream settings, marketplace, request,
//! support, admin, import, and project surfaces ingest this packet rather than
//! minting per-feature form semantics.
