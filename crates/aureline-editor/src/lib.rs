//! Editor viewport, composition, and paint primitives.
//!
//! This crate owns the canonical editor viewport model: scroll offsets, caret
//! and selection state, line-layout caching, and the software compositor used
//! by the current desktop shell raster path. Higher layers (shell zones,
//! command surfaces, and future multi-window wiring) should treat the types in
//! this crate as the single source of truth for editor viewport paint and
//! invalidation semantics.
