//! Notification routing for toast, banner, and status surfaces.
//!
//! This module is the protected-row consumer for the typed notification
//! envelope frozen at
//! [`/schemas/ux/notification_envelope.schema.json`] and its reviewer-facing
//! seed at [`/docs/ux/notification_routing_seed.md`]. The shell does NOT
//! mint a parallel notification vocabulary: it deserializes envelopes,
//! routes them onto toast / banner / status / durable-activity surfaces,
//! collapses repeats by `dedupe_key_scheme` + `dedupe_key_ref`, and keeps
//! every routed surface pointed at the same `reopen_target` so a toast and
//! a status row both reopen the same canonical object.
//!
//! ## Pieces
//!
//! - [`envelope`] — typed Rust mirror of the boundary schema. Adapters and
//!   tests deserialize fixtures into [`envelope::NotificationEnvelope`].
//! - [`router`] — the dedupe-aware [`router::NotificationRouter`] that takes
//!   an envelope and emits a [`router::RoutedNotification`] (one
//!   [`router::SurfaceRoute`] per recommended surface).
//! - [`routes`] — per-surface row projections
//!   ([`routes::NotificationSurfaceRow`],
//!   [`routes::NotificationSurfaceSnapshot`]) the chrome reads when it
//!   draws toasts, banners, status items, and durable activity rows.
//!
//! ## Failure-drill posture
//!
//! When the same canonical event arrives multiple times, the router emits
//! `delivered` receipts on the first emission and `deduped_canonical_event`
//! (or `deduped_grouped_burst`) receipts on subsequent emissions for
//! surfaces that have already lit up. The reopen target ref is preserved on
//! every receipt so the deduped row in the activity center still leads to
//! the same canonical object — preventing split-brain state across surfaces.
