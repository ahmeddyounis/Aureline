# Stabilize the Next.js Expert workflow pack with app/router, server/client boundaries, and environment truth — stable contract

Status: Stable lane proof for the Next.js Expert workflow pack.

This document is the reviewer-facing contract for the stable Next.js
Expert workflow pack truth packet. The packet is the single source of
truth that the editor framework pack panel, workflow companion,
framework settings/help, CLI/headless inspector, support export,
release proof index, Help/About proof card, and the conformance
dashboard all read; surfaces MUST NOT mint local copies or paraphrase
workflow-pack posture.

The packet pins the Next.js Expert workflow pack across three
intertwined truths:

1. The **app/router workflow loops** — create, open, run, test, debug,
   rename, and review on App Router and Pages Router archetype repos.
2. The **server/client boundary** — every row that crosses the
   server-component vs. client-component split (React Server
   Components, Server Actions, `"use client"` islands, route handlers)
   binds a dedicated `server_client_boundary_row` and a disclosure ref.
3. The **environment truth** — build-time, request-time, edge-runtime,
   and node-runtime environment surfaces are bound by a dedicated
   `environment_truth_row` so that workflow steps that depend on a
   specific environment surface the gap rather than over-claim.

## What the packet asserts

For each governed *workflow pack × workflow-pack row* the packet
asserts:

1. The **workflow pack class** — currently
   `next_js_expert_workflow_pack`. Every certified packet MUST carry at
   least one row for each required pack.
2. The **workflow-pack row class** — one of `pack_qualification`,
   `workflow_loop`, `framework_migration_row`, `archetype_repo_row`,
   `server_client_boundary_row`, `environment_truth_row`,
   `design_partner_row`, `unsupported_gap`, `known_limit`, or
   `downgrade_automation`. A `workflow_loop` row MUST bind a real
   workflow-loop step; no other row class is permitted to bind one.
3. The **support class** — one of `expert_grade`, `stable_below_expert`,
   `beta_grade_only`, `preview_only`, `unsupported`, or
   `support_unbound`. The validator refuses to certify a row that
   claims `expert_grade` while any binding is unbound (support, known
   limit, downgrade automation, or evidence).
4. The **workflow-loop class** — one of `create`, `open`, `run`,
   `test`, `debug`, `rename`, `review`, or `not_applicable`. A pack
   that claims `expert_grade` workflow-pack support MUST cover every
   certified workflow-loop step.
5. The **evidence class** — one of `archetype_repo_evidence`,
   `framework_migration_evidence`, `design_partner_evidence`,
   `fixture_repo_evidence`, `conformance_suite_evidence`,
   `benchmark_evidence`, `server_client_boundary_evidence`,
   `environment_truth_evidence`, `docs_disclosure_evidence`, or
   `evidence_unbound`. A row whose evidence class is `evidence_unbound`
   is refused.
6. The **known-limit class** — one of `none_declared`,
   `framework_subset_only`, `language_subset_only`,
   `archetype_subset_only`, `migration_subset_only`,
   `server_client_boundary_subset_only`,
   `environment_truth_subset_only`, `unsupported_runtime_target`,
   `beta_capability_sample_only`, or `limit_unbound`. A row whose
   known limit is `limit_unbound` is refused.
7. The **downgrade-automation class** — one of `none`,
   `auto_narrow_on_missing_fixture`, `auto_narrow_on_missing_archetype`,
   `auto_narrow_on_failed_migration`, `auto_narrow_on_framework_gap`,
   `auto_narrow_on_unproven_server_client_boundary`,
   `auto_narrow_on_unproven_environment_truth`,
   `auto_demote_on_low_confidence`, `auto_block_on_missing_evidence`,
   `manual_only_pending_review`, or `automation_unbound`. A row whose
   automation is `automation_unbound` is refused.
8. The **workflow-pack confidence class** — `high_confidence`,
   `medium_confidence`, or `low_confidence`. A row that claims
   `expert_grade` at `low_confidence` is narrowed below stable until
   evidence grows.
9. The **evidence refs** — every row preserves at least one
   repo-relative evidence ref proving the workflow-pack claim.
10. The **disclosure ref** — every row that is not `expert_grade`, that
    declares a non-`none_declared` known limit, or that binds a
    non-`none` downgrade automation MUST carry a repo-relative
    disclosure ref shown to the user.

## Boundary safety

Every row carries `raw_source_material_excluded`, `secrets_excluded`,
and `ambient_authority_excluded`. The validator emits
`raw_source_material_present`, `secrets_present`, or
`ambient_authority_present` as a blocker for any row that flips one of
those booleans to false. The packet never admits raw source bodies,
secrets, ambient credentials, environment variable values, or provider
payloads. Environment-truth rows bind only the *surface* (build-time vs
request-time vs edge runtime vs node runtime) — never the secret
values themselves.

## What blocks the stable claim

The packet blocks publication when any of the following appears:

- a row claims `expert_grade` while its support, known-limit,
  downgrade-automation, or evidence class is unbound,
- a pack that claims `expert_grade` workflow-pack support is missing a
  certified `workflow_loop` row for any of the seven required steps
  (create, open, run, test, debug, rename, review),
- a `workflow_loop` row drops its workflow-loop step binding,
- a non-`workflow_loop` row binds a workflow-loop step it cannot
  certify,
- a row narrowed below `expert_grade` drops its disclosure ref,
- a row declares a non-`none_declared` known limit and drops its
  disclosure ref,
- a row binds a non-`none` downgrade automation and drops its
  disclosure ref,
- any of the eight required consumer projections is missing or
  collapses one of the closed vocabularies (pack, row class, support
  class, workflow loop, known limit, downgrade automation, or evidence
  class),
- raw source bodies, secrets, or ambient credentials slip past the
  boundary,
- the stored promotion state disagrees with the derived findings.

## Required consumer projections

The packet is preserved verbatim across eight consumer projections:

| Projection                    | Surface                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `editor_framework_pack_panel` | Editor framework pack panel          |
| `workflow_companion`          | Workflow companion / runner panel    |
| `framework_settings`          | Framework settings / help surface    |
| `cli_headless`                | CLI/headless inspector               |
| `support_export`              | Support export bundle                |
| `release_proof_index`         | Release proof index entry            |
| `help_about`                  | Help/About proof card                |
| `conformance_dashboard`       | Conformance dashboard row            |

A projection that collapses any closed vocabulary, drops the packet
id, drops the pack class, row class, support class, workflow-loop,
known-limit, downgrade-automation, or evidence-class vocabulary, or
leaks raw private material immediately blocks the stable claim.

## How to read the packet

Consumers materialize the packet through
`NextJsExpertWorkflowPackTruthPacket::materialize` and then read the
projection that matches their surface. The packet is metadata-only and
suitable for inclusion in any support export or release proof bundle.
